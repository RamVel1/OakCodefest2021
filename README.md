## App Idea

The idea of our project is to create an "Homework" app related to the Education field. We have created the app using Flutter and Dart. So the idea for this app has been inspired by the fact that many of us are accustomed to online classes due to COVID-19 Pandemic. As a result, we as students may sometimes find it a burden to organize our huge workload of homework. Therefore, our group seeks to fix this agonizing task, by creating an homework organizing app that allows users to create an account (Log In or Sign Up) and allow one to create certain homework cards, which allows them to save their homework as small cards. These cards will basically contain an overview of the homework they should complete along with the date of submission i.e the deadline. This app can be used by students as a side-by-side addition to their daily classes. Hence, we the members of this team believe in efficient homework management apps as the solution to organizing studies more effectively, and we have used this as a sole inspiration for our app.
